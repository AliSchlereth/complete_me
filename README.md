# Compete_Me - Trie Data Structure
This project explores the creation and utilization of a Trie made in Ruby.  
This implementation allows a user to suggest a partial word and receive back suggested words that mighth complete the given substring. A user may upload their own dictionary, insert specific words, suggest partial words and select complete words from a given list. The program is built to learn user preferences and will adjust results accordingly.
